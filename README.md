# WEB-102-Change-Calculator

![](images/ProjectScreenshot.png)

Second project completed in San Diego Code School curriculum, gives a user the ability to enter a price 
for an item plus the amount received and it will calculate total change along with how it will be paid out.
Now revised with refactored code, local express server, and minor sass styling for appearance sake.

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
